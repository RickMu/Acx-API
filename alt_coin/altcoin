The distribution of EOS Tokens will occur at the end of each set period during the EOS Distribution Period. The purchase price a buyer receives for EOS Tokens depends upon the actions of all other users sending ether (ETH) to the EOS Token Contract during the same period. Everyone sending ETH during the same period receives the same price. It is possible for other people to send in a large amount of ETH after Buyer and dramatically increase the price Buyer and everyone else pays per EOS Token received.

Blockchain Delay Risk. On the Ethereum blockchain, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block production can occur at random times. For example, ETH contributed to the EOS Smart Contract in the final seconds of a distribution period may not get included for that period. Buyer acknowledges and understands that the Ethereum blockchain may not include the Buyers transaction at the time Buyer expects and Buyer may not receive EOS Tokens the same day Buyer sends ETH. ", "7.5. Ethereum Blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain is prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also intentionally spam the Ethereum network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic tokens. Buyer acknowledges and understands that Ethereum block producers may not include Buyers transaction when Buyer wants or Buyers transaction may not be included at all.", "7.6.

Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the EOS Distribution Contract, the EOS Token Contract or the EOS Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ethereum platform rests on open source software and EOS Tokens are based on open source software, there is the risk that Ethereum smart contracts may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the EOS Tokens or result in the loss of Buyers EOS Tokens, the loss of Buyers ability to access or control Buyers EOS Tokens or the loss of ETH in Buyers account. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and holders of EOS Tokens are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.", "7.8. Access to Private Keys. EOS Tokens purchased by Buyer may be held by Buyer in Buyers digital wallet or vault, which requires a private key, or a combination of private keys, for access. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with Buyers digital wallet or vault storing EOS Tokens will result in loss of such EOS Tokens, access to Buyers EOS Token balance and/or any initial balances in blockchains created by third parties. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault service Buyer uses, may be able to misappropriate Buyers EOS Tokens. Company is not responsible for any such losses.", "7.9. EOS Tokens Will Become Non-Transferable. Buyer acknowledges and understands that EOS Tokens will become non-transferrable within twenty-three (23)  hours after the end of the EOS Distribution Period. At this time, Buyer will no longer be able to map a public key to Buyers account and Buyer will not be able to transfer EOS Tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Some cryptocurrency exchanges may on their own accord enable EOS Tokens to continue trading, but the exchanges will be unable to accept new deposits or authorize withdrawals of EOS Tokens.", "7.10New Technology. The EOS.IO Software and the EOS Platform and all of the matters set forth in the White Paper are new and untested. The EOS.IO Software might not be capable of completion, implementation or adoption. It is possible that no blockchain utilizing the EOS.IO Software will be ever be launched and there may never be an operational EOS Platform. Buyer should not rely on the EOS.IO Software or the ability to receive tokens associated with the EOS Platform in the future. Even if the EOS.IO Software is completed, implemented and adopted, it might not function as intended, and any tokens associated with a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO Software may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable. Also, technology is changing rapidly, so the EOS Tokens and any tokens transferable on the EOS Platform may become outdated.", "7.11. Reliance on Third-Parties. Even if completed, the EOS.IO Software will rely, in whole or partly, on third parties to adopt and implement it and to continue to develop, supply, and otherwise support it.

Failure to Map a Public Key to Buyers Account. Failure of Buyer to map a public key to Buyers account may result in third parties being unable to recognize Buyers EOS Token balance on the Ethereum blockchain when and if they configure the initial balances of a new blockchain based upon the EOS.IO Software of which Company makes no representation or guarantee. ", "7.13. Exchange & Counterparty Risks. If Buyer sends ETH to the EOS Token Contract from an exchange or an account that Buyer does not control, pursuant to the EOS Token Contract, EOS Tokens will be allocated to the account that has sent ETH; therefore, Buyer may never receive or be able to recover Buyers EOS Tokens. Furthermore, if Buyer chooses to maintain or hold EOS Tokens through a cryptocurrency exchange or other third party, Buyers EOS Tokens may be stolen or lost. In addition, third parties may not recognize Buyers claim to any derivative tokens if and when launched by third parties according to the distribution rules set in the EOS.IO Software. By using the EOS Distribution Contract, using the EOS Token Contract and/or by purchasing EOS Tokens, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer sends ETH to the EOS Token Contract through an exchange account and/or holds EOS Tokens on a cryptocurrency exchange or with another third party at Buyers own and sole risk.", "7.14Changes to the EOS.IO Software. The EOS.IO Software is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although Company intends for the EOS.IO Software to have the features and specifications set forth in the White Paper, Company may make changes to such features and specifications for any number of reasons, and any party that adopts the EOS.IO Software and launches the EOS Platform also may make changes, any of which may mean that the EOS Platform does not meet Buyers expectations.", "7.15Risk of Alternative Blockchains based on EOS.IO Software. The EOS.IO Software will not likely be licensed under an open source license until after the end of the EOS Distribution Period; however, it is possible somebody will not respect the EOS.IO Software copyright or will modify the EOS.IO Software after it has been released under an open source license. Therefore, it is possible for someone to utilize the EOS.IO Software to build and launch blockchain protocols using a token distribution other than the one intended for the EOS Tokens pursuant to the EOS.IO Software both prior to or after the EOS.IO Software has become licensed as open source.", "7.16Risk of Lack of Transferability in Blockchain Cryptographic Token. The EOS.IO Software is built such that any blockchain that adopts the EOS.IO Software will require approval of holders of not less than 15% of the total issued and outstanding EOS Tokens before tokens on such blockchain (the \"Blockchain Tokens) can be transferred. In other words, if the EOS.IO Software is adopted, it will be the responsibility of holders holding at least 15% of the issued and outstanding EOS Tokens to adopt one or more blockchains in order for Blockchain Tokens received on such blockchains to be transferrable. Buyer acknowledges, understands and agrees that if the EOS.IO Software is adopted and the requisite vote described above is not obtained, Buyer may not be able to transfer any Blockchain Tokens Buyer receives.", "7.17. Project Completion. The development of the EOS.IO Software may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects, or departure of key personnel.", "7.18. Lack of Interest. Even if the EOS.IO Software is finished and adopted and the EOS Platform is launched, the ongoing success of the EOS Platform relies on the interest and participation of third parties like developers. There can be no assurance or guarantee that there will be sufficient interest or participation in the EOS Platform.", "7.19.Uncertain Regulatory Framework. The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact EOS Tokens in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that EOS Tokens are regulated financial instruments that require registration. Company may cease the distribution of EOS Tokens, the development of the EOS.IO Software or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so.", "7.20. Risk of Government Action. As noted above, the industry in which Company operates is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not examine the operations of Company and/or pursue enforcement actions against Company. Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting Company in particular. All of this may subject Company to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Company to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Companys reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the EOS Tokens and/or the development of the EOS.IO Software.", "8.1. Limitation of Liability.

No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. Any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement is personal to Buyer and Company and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.", "10.1.Governing Law and Venue.
