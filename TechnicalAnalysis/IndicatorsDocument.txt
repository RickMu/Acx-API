How to analyse techincal indicator's relevance

- Conventional Approach investigate how they are used to make decisions
- Analysis of their weights in ML cases


Indicators
Moving Average
Momentum
Stochastic K
Stochastic D
relative strength index
Moving Average Convergence Divergence
Larry William's R
Accumulation Distribution Oscillator
Commodity Channel Index

Moving Average:(Periods, Intervals)
Use-Case:
when trend is looking up any cross over between the actual price and the moving average implies enter
when down intersection means exit

Use-Case
Utility of 2 moving averages one with long period of time and the other with shorter period of time
Cross overs mean change in trend

Momentum: (Periods, Intervals)

M = P - PN(price n days ago)



RSI: (Periods, Intervals)

RSI = 100 - 100/(1+RS)
RS = (totalGain/N) / (totalLoss/N )

Consecutive RS = (prevAvgGain * N-1 + CurrentGain) / N
				----------------------------------------
				(prevAvgLoss * N-1 + CurrentLoss) / N


Stochastic K and D: (Periods, Intervals)
K = C-LN/ (HN-LN)
D = 100*(HN-LN)
